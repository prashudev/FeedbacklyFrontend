I am using a React NextJS app to collect feedback on a presentation I am giving. The app should also display feedback responses.

Your first task is to create a feedback form named "Presentation Feedback"
Below "Presentation Feedback", add a "Enter your Name" text field.

Below it add the below questions:

To what extent do you believe Gen AI can replace traditional coding methods?
How likely will you adopt Gen AI tools in your current development process?
How likely are you to replace your morning coffee with AI-generated code?
 
For each question, have a clickable star icon to represent 1-5 rating. Make the icons gradually appear bigger from 1 to 5. 
Add a Submit button that calls a backend POST API https://feedbacklybackend.onrender.com/api/v1/submitfeedback
, sending request body in below json format
{
    "userName": "Name",
    "feedback": [
        {
            "question": "To what extent do you believe Gen AI can replace traditional coding methods?",
            "rating": 5
        },
        {
            "question": "How likely will you adopt Gen AI tools in your current development process?",
            "rating": 2
        },
        {
            "question": "How likely are you to replace your morning coffee with AI-generated code?",
            "rating": 2
        }
    ]
}
 
Next, Add a View Feedback hyperlink button to load a component to display feedback responses.
On clicking Feedback hyperlink, make GET API call to https://feedbacklybackend.onrender.com/api/v1/getfeedbackresponse

Which responds back with below json data:
[
  {
    "userName": "Prashanth",
    "feedback": [
      {
        "question": "To what extent do you believe Gen AI can replace traditional coding methods?",
        "rating": 4,
        "geminiResponse": [
          {
            "sentimentAnalysisScore": 4,
            "response": "**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Specific Question:** The question is well-defined and asks about the potential of Generative AI (Gen AI) to replace traditional coding methods.\n\n2. **Rating Provided:** The rating of 4 out of 5 indicates a moderate to positive evaluation.\n\n**Potential Areas of Improvement (for a lower rating):**\n\n* Provide more specific examples of how Gen AI can or cannot replace traditional coding methods.\n* Discuss the limitations and challenges of using Gen AI for coding.\n* Address potential concerns about the impact of Gen AI on software development jobs.\n\n**Positive Aspects (for a higher rating):**\n\n* The user acknowledges the potential of Gen AI to revolutionize coding methods.\n* The user demonstrates a balanced understanding of the topic, recognizing that Gen AI may not completely replace traditional coding but could significantly enhance it.\n* The user's feedback is clear and concise, providing a straightforward evaluation of the question."
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "question": "How likely will you adopt Gen AI tools in your current development process?",
        "rating": 4,
        "geminiResponse": [
          {
            "sentimentAnalysisScore": 4,
            "response": "1. **Question:** The question asked gauges the likelihood of adopting Generative AI (Gen AI) tools in the current development process.\n2. **Rating:** A rating of 4 out of 5 indicates a positive inclination towards adopting Gen AI tools.\n3. **Areas of Improvement (if rating is low):** If the rating was lower, potential areas of improvement could include addressing concerns around data privacy, bias mitigation, and the need for enhanced training and upskilling of developers.\n4. **Positive Aspects (if rating is high):** A high rating highlights the perceived value of Gen AI tools, such as potential improvements in development efficiency, enhanced creativity, and the streamlining of certain developmental tasks."
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "question": "How likely are you to replace your morning coffee with AI-generated code?",
        "rating": 4,
        "geminiResponse": [
          {
            "sentimentAnalysisScore": 4,
            "response": "**Analysis:**\n\n**1. Question:**\n\nThe question is specific and relates to the potential adoption of AI-generated code as a replacement for morning coffee.\n\n**2. Rating:**\n\nA rating of 4 out of 5 indicates a positive response, suggesting a willingness to consider replacing coffee with AI code.\n\n**3. Improvement Areas:**\n\nIf the rating had been lower, potential areas for improvement include:\n\n* Clarifying the benefits and drawbacks of AI-generated code in replacing coffee\n* Providing more tangible examples or evidence of the efficacy of AI code in this context\n* Addressing any potential concerns or hesitations users may have\n\n**4. Positive Aspects:**\n\nThe high rating highlights the following positive aspects:\n\n* Users are generally receptive to the idea of using AI technology in their daily routines.\n* They recognize the potential value of AI-generated code as a substitute for activities such as coffee consumption.\n* This feedback provides valuable insight into user preferences and the potential market for AI-generated code in everyday applications."
